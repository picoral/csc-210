## Graphs

A graph:

* is a non-linear data structure
* stores connected data (a network of people)
* consists of vertices/nodes and edges/lines

A Graph `G` is composed of a set of vertices(`V`) and a set of edges(`E`)

The graph is denoted by $G(V, E)$

## vertices and edges

* A vertex represents the entity (e.g., people)
* An edge represents the relationship between entities (e.g., a personâ€™s friendships).

Graphs can be weighted and unweighted

## Representations of Graph
