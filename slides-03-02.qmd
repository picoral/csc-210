## Two recursive algorithms

* Exhaustive Search	
* Backtracking	

These are `brute-force` algorithms

Used for problems that have a small and well-defined search space, where it is feasible to check all possible solutions

## Backtracking

Main idea: find every solution incrementally by trying different options, then abandoning them if they are not suitable

In other words: exhaustive search + conditions for suitable solution
