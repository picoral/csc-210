* CR stands for `carriage return` -- character that returns the print head to column 0 
* LF stands for `linefeed` â€“ character that advances the paper one line

`\r` (carriage `r`eturn) and `\n` (`n`ew line) characters for modern computers

## Differences in characters

[There's an entire wikipedia page on this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)

Unix uses `\n` and Windows uses `\r\n` (for most applications, not all)

Not a problem for autograder because your code will be compiled and run on a Unix VM

A problem that you will encounter many times for other reasons

JUnit tests fail because the text file that your output is compared against uses only `\n`
