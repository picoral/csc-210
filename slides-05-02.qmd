## First bug 

"The team at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that their computer, the Mark II, was delivering consistent errors. When they opened the computer’s hardware, they found ... a moth. The trapped insect had disrupted the electronics of the computer."

[Sep 9, 1947 CE: World’s First Computer Bug](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/)

##  How to catch bugs

* Error message (easiest type to solve, the message tells you what to fix)

For all other bugs, we need to know what the correct/expected behavior is in order to be able to identify when the application is not behaving in the way we expect/want it to behave.

* Unit testing
* Bug reports from users

Once we have a way to check that our code is not doing what it should be doing, we need to isolate (or find) where the bug is.
