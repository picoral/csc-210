title: "Compiling"

Before you follow the instructions below, make sure you have this class in a working directory on Eclipse:

```{java}
public class OddEven {
	
	public static boolean isEven(int n) {
		return n % 2 == 0;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		int number = Integer.valueOf(args[0]);
		if (isEven(number)) {
			System.out.println("Even");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Odd");
		}

	}

}
```


1. Download the [JDK Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
1. Open a local terminal (that can be done in several ways, on Eclipse go to `Window` > `Show View` > `Terminal`)
1. Here's what my terminal looks like: ![](images/blank-terminal.png)
1. Change directory (cd) into your project folder (my working directory is in a folder called CSC210 on my Desktop): ![](images/cd-into-directory.png)
1. We will compile our `.java` file first by entering `javac src/OddEven.java` into our local terminal
1. Then we will cd into our `bin` folder: `cd bin`
1. To run our binary code with an argument we can enter `java OddEven 2`
