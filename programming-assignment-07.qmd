# PA7 - Garden GUI 


## Learning Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to improve on basic JavaFX knowledge by adding
event-driven GUI programming to the PA6 - Garden GUI program.

## The Assignment


For PA7, you will be adding events to the GUI representation of PA6. This means
there will be no input file to read from. Instead of reading the input file
from the command line arguments, you will read in the number of rows and columns
of plots in the garden from the command line.  Then along with the garden visualization
you will create a TextField where a user can input a garden simulation command
(e.g., grow 1, plant (2,3) sunflower, ...) and then click on a simulate
button to show the results of that command.

Another interesting aspect of PA7 is that you will be continuing to refine
the Garden simulation code.  Some of your code will change and some of the
code from previous assignments should be removed.


## What needs to be removed

**File reading:** Since we are no longer reading commands in from a file,
all code that is used to read in from a file is no longer needed.  You will
still need to parse commands however.

**Delay Code:** In the previous assignment a delay was needed to show the output
for every command, for this assignment this is no longer needed since we are running
one command at a time via a graphical user interface.

## What needs to be added

**User input:** Since we will not be reading from a file, we are going to need some way
to read in commands from the user.  We recommend a TextArea and a button to cause
the execution of the command in that TextArea.  Feel free to try different approaches.

**Event Handlers:** To use the information that the user provides your code must have
at least one Event Handler. This should grab the information from the user and do something with it whenever a specified event occurs. (clicking of a button and/or pressing enter on keyboard)

## What needs to be changed

**Command line arguments:** Instead of reading in a filename from the command line, you will be reading in both the width and height of the garden.


## Resources

The provided code uses some new concepts.  We will be covering them in class.  Additionally, here are some references.

  * Text Field, <https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/ui_controls/text-field.htm>
  * Working with Canvas, <https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/canvas/jfxpub-canvas.htm>

## General requirements

This assignment is different from other assignments you've had so far 
in that you are given a lot more freedom to design your output the way 
you want. However you choose to receive graphical input for your
garden, the following general requirements must be met:

* A user should be able to type in a command and submit it via the GUI. This means that there should be somewhere to insert text and some way to submit that text. Both of these must be **intuitive**, that means that the user must understand where he/she should insert commands and how to submit said command by only looking at the GUI. 

* Each plant must be **one-of-a-kind**, meaning they must be distinguishable 
  from any other plant and the background (in shape, color, etc)

* Each command must be **visually noticeable**. This means that when 
  'GROW 1' is called for example, it should be visually obvious that every 
  plant just grew by 1. 

* There must be a command log which displays commands as they are being executed. 
 

* You must handle errors. Errors that don't cause the program to stop 
  (such as 'Can't grow here') should be **distinguishable** in the command log. 
  For errors that do cause the program to stop, such as 'Invalid dimension input'
  should still print to to the standard output.

## Grading Criteria

Half of the this assignment grade will be a working GUI. Record a video that
shows your name in the header for the App.java file and your name in the 
window title. Submit your assignment code to gradescope.

The other half of the assignment grade will be your decomposition and code clarity.

Decomposition

* Points will be taken off for copy, pasted, and edited code that
  should have been encapsulated in a method.

* **This program should use fewer than 10 .java files.**
  Each of these files should be (<300 lines).

* Each method should be less than 30 lines.  This INCLUDES
  comments, but not the method header.  It is easier to read a 
  function if it can all fit on one screen.
  
Code Clarity

* YOU should be able to read, understand, and explain your own code
  to someone else a couple days after you wrote it.
  
  * No magic numbers
  * No methods written to just get the test cases to work

* There needs to be a balance between no comments in the body of the
  methods and a comment for every line in the program.  Either extreme
  will result in points off.

* **The file header should include instructions on how someone would
  use this program.**  To use the program, one would need to know the
  input file format.  One would also need to know the command line arguments
  that should be passed to the program.

* Use meaningful variable names.  Loop iterators can
  be simple (i for integers, s for strings, n for numbers, etc.).

* The clearest code examples will be anonymously shown in class.

* The most obfuscated code examples will be anonymously shown in class
  with suggestions for improvement.
  
## Submission

For this assignment, you are **REQUIRED** to submit all of the following files
to Gradescope. 

  * All the Java source files needed to run your program.
  * A video showing your GUI working.

Write your own code. We will be using a tool that finds similar code.

It is recommended that when talking with others about the assignment, do not write
anything down.
