# Course Description

This course is 	an introduction to the development of large scale software. Topics include modularization, design patterns, documentation, unit testing, source code control, build systems, debuggers, and performance tuning; all of the tools necessary for developing software as opposed to writing small programs.


# Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

* decompose the solution for a project specification into subproblems and iteratively develop the project using multiple interacting classes, class inheritance, hierarchical data structures, and/or event-driven programming 

* use data structures (i.e., hash table, tree, and graph), common algorithm patterns (i.e., exhaustive search, divide and conquer, recursive backtracking, and heuristic), unit testing, and debugging to write a correct solution to each sub-problem and integrate the sub-problem solutions into a complete working project (currently using Java).

* evaluate the decomposition, clarity, performance, and style of a program when provided with example solution components and a rubric

* compare and contrast programming in two programming languages (currently Python and Java).

* build graphical user input and output for programs (currently using JavaFX) 

# Instructor, Teaching Staff, and Contact Information

## Instructor: Adriana Picoral

* Office: Gould-Simpson 811
* Email: adrianaps@arizona.edu
* Office hours (open door, drop in, my office GS 811):
  * Monday 2:30pm to 3:30pm
  * Wednesday 10:30am to 12:30pm
  
There will also be many undergraduate TAs. See the class website for their contact info!

# Course Format and Teaching Methods

The class meets in person, in Gittings 129b on Monday, Wednesday and Friday 9am to 9:50am.

Students are responsible for reading the announcements posted on the course website and D2L. Students are also responsible for completing all of the posted reading assignments, quizzes, drills, programming assignments, and peer reviews.

This course includes three class meetings per week and one lab session per week (this is a 4-unit course).

* The class meetings will be interactive and collaborative (meaning, you will need a laptop computer to work on in-class activities during class).
* Be in your seat and ready to go at 9am. Class will start promptly at 9am.
* You will sit with a group of 3 other students. 
* There will be approximately 5 TAs and an instructor in the room to help with
activities.
* Semi-anonymous questions can be asked during class using slido (https://www.sli.do/).
* There will be at least one think-group-share activity per class session. For the share portion, a group will be randomly selected and a volunteer from that group will share what they discussed in their group.


Lab sessions will involve learning material that is NOT covered in class and doing short programming exercises.

# Grading Scale and Policies

Grades will be posted on D2L. All graded work will be done and submitted individually. Discussions amongst students in the class are encouraged, but DO NOT copy code or text from other students, tutors, or ANYONE else. Letter grades will be assigned using the typical scale: >=90 A, >=80 B, >=70 C, >=60 D, and <60 E.

The course grade consists of the following:

* Programming Assignments, 20%
* Final, 20%
* Midterm 1, 15%
* Midterm 2, 15%
* Sections, 10%
* Quizzes, 10%
* Peer Reviews and Drills, 10%

## Due Dates and Submission:

Programming assignments, drills,and peer reviews ar edu eat 11:30 pm on their associated DUE DATE. Programming assignments and drills will need to use revision control in github and be submitted to Gradescope. Make sure to commit and push frequently to github. If you have been committing and pushing to github, then we can grab a copy of your assignment if you happen to forget to submit to Gradescope (15 points will be deducted for doing that, but it is better than a 0). You can submit drills or programming assignments to Gradescope **as many times as you want before the deadline**. Drills will be automatically graded by Gradescope. Peer reviews will be done in Aropa. Some of the programming assignments will include instructions on how to submit material to Aropa so others can peer review your programs. See the next section for actual due dates.

## Grading Promptness

Grades for the programming assignments, drills, and peer reviews will be provided within 5 school days of the deadline. Any exceptions to this will be announced on Piazza and in class.

## Late Policy

Anything late will not be graded and you will receive a 0% for that programming assignment, drill, or peer review. Anything medical and/or disability-related should be discussed with DRC on campus (https://drc.arizona.edu/students/connect-drc). They work with instructors to put any accommodations in place.

## Dispute of Grade Policy

Any requests for grading corrections must be done within 10 school days of the assignment being due. 

## University policy 

University policy regarding grades and grading systems is available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system

Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available at http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete and http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal, respectively.
