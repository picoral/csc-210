## `static` methods

The Java construct for implementing functions is known as the `static` method.

Properties of static methods:

* **Multiple arguments** -- static methods can take on more than one argument, and therefore can have more than one parameter variable
* **Multiple methods** -- define as many static methods as you want in a .java file. These methods are independent and can appear in any order in the file. A static method can call any other static method in the same file or any static method in a Java library

## `static` methods

* **Overloading** -- Static methods whose signatures differ are different static methods. Using the same name for two static methods whose signatures differ is known as overloading.
* **Single return value** A Java method provides only one return value to the caller, of the type declared in the method signature

## `static` methods

* **Scope** -- The scope of a variable is the part of the program that can refer to that variable by name. The scope of a variable declared in a static method is limited to that method's body. You cannot refer to a variable in one static method that is declared in another.
