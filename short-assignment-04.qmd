# Short Assignment 04

## Introduction 

In this lab we will be writing JUnit tests.

Writing software is hard. Plain and simple, programming is not easy. Over the past 
70 years there have been many methods developed to make the process of writing code 
easier. Once such technique is called **Test-Driven Development**. The idea is 
simple: you know what you want your code to do, but you do not know how to write 
code to do it. So start by writing the test cases, then write code that makes those 
test cases pass. Test-Driven Development is used in industry, and you will most probably
do it in CS335. In Java, JUnit is a framework that allows us to write test cases with 
ease and automate the testing process.  Our goal is to introduce you to JUnit to 
help you test the code you write better.

## Set up

Download the `BasicArithmetic.java` file from [GitHub](https://github.com/picoral/CSC210-lab04) and
set up your working environment on Eclipse with this file.

There are several ways to download the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/picoral/CSC210-lab04). Click on
the green code button:

You can click on `Download Zip` or you can copy the `HTTPS` or `SSH` addresses and then use your shell (terminal, command line) to `git clone` it to a specific folder (maybe your working environment folder for Eclipse):

`git clone https://github.com/picoral/CSC210-lab04.git`

or

`git clone git@github.com:picoral/CSC210-lab04.git`


Once you have your project set up with the `BasicArithmetic.java` file you downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/picoral/CSC210-lab04), you can create a JUnit test file following these steps:

1. Go to `New > JUnit Test Case` ![](images/junit-step1.png)
1. Name your file `BasicArithmeticTest` ![](images/junit-step2.png)
1. Click `ok` on the prompt window about adding JUnit library ![](images/junit-step3.png)

To use JUnit, each test case (a single method defined 
like the one below) should be responsible for testing one piece of functionality. 
```
@Test
public void testOneThing() {
}
```

## Writing test cases

Write at least one test case for each of these:

* sum of two numbers
* subtraction of two numbers
* multiplication of two numbers
* division of two numbers

Your JUnit tab should look something like this:
