## MVC (Model-View-Controller) 

Software design pattern 

Three parts:

* `Model` keeps the data (internal representations of information)
* `View` is what users see (GUI) and receives input from the user
* `Controller` connects the two

The model is independent of the user-interface

The controller converts user input to commands for the model or view
