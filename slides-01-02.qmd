## Typing

* Python does dynamic typing

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
word = "car"
number = 3
new_list = []
names = ["Pedro", "Melissa", "Jessica"]
```

* Static typing in Java

```{java}
String word = "car";
int number = 3;
List<Integer> newList = new List<>();
List<String> names = new List<>();
```

## Variable assignment

* To declare and give initial values to variables use `=`, which means becomes or take on the value of (assignment)

```{python}
int credits = 4;
double grade = 3.67;
String name = "Chris";
int hours = 10;
boolean ready = hours >= 8;
```

## Comments

* Java requires a lot of code to express a simple concept.
* You need to be much more explicit when writing Java than Python (more words to type in Java)
* Reduced readability by humans as a result
* Comments are extra important
