## Before we start

We will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) as our IDE for this course.

It's good practice to have a working environment folder and work within projects. (DEMO)

I'll create a `GettingStarted` project, and then a new `class` called `HelloWorld`

Opt to create a public main method

```{java}
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

## Typing

* Python does dynamic typing

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
word = "car"
number = 3
new_list = []
names = ["Pedro", "Melissa", "Jessica"]
```

* Static typing in Java

```{java}
String word = "car";
int number = 3;
List<Integer> newList = new List<>();
List<String> names = new List<>();
```

## Try it out

Modify your main method in your `HelloWorld` class to assign the string literal `"Hello World!"` to a `String` variable name, and then print out that variable instead.

Questions:

* Can you use both double and single strings to create the variable?

* Does concatenation with the `+` operator work?

* Can we concatenate `String`, `char` and `int` (or a combination of these)? 

## Try it out -- solution

```{java}
public class HelloWorld {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String message = "Hello World!";
		char space = ' ';
		int number = 210;
		System.out.println(message + space + number);

	}

}
```


## Variable assignment

* To declare and give initial values to variables use `=`, which means becomes or take on the value of (assignment)

```{java}
int credits = 4;
double grade = 3.67;
String name = "Chris";
int hours = 10;
boolean ready = hours >= 8;
```

Question:

* Can you change the type of a variable in Java?

* Why are certain types all lower-cased, while others are title cased?

## Types

All primitive types in Java and lower-cased.

A primitive cannot have a method attached to it and connat be subclasses (there is no Object) 

Java types that start with a upper cacse are Objects.

## Comments

* Java requires a lot of code to express a simple concept.
* You need to be much more explicit when writing Java than Python (more words to type in Java)
* Comments are extra important

```{java}
// one line comment

/*
  multi-line
  comment
 */
    
/**
 * JavaDoc comments for external documentation
 * @returns description of what returns   
 */
```

## JavaDoc Comments

JavaDoc comments may be placed above any class, method, or field

Two sections:

* description 
* standalone block tags (marked with `@`)

## Practice

Create a Java application that determines if an integer is odd or even

## Solution 1

```{java}
public class OddsOrEvens {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int number;
		number = 3;
		boolean result = number % 2 == 0;
		System.out.println(result);

	}

}
```


## Solution 2

```{java}
public class OddsOrEvens {
	
	public static boolean isOdd(int number) {
		return number % 2 == 1;
	}
	
	public static boolean isEven(int number) {
		return number % 2 == 0;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println(isOdd(3));
		System.out.println(isEven(3));

	}

}
```

## Solution 3

```{java}
public class OddsOrEvens {
	
	public static boolean isOdd(int number) {
	    // if integer is not divisible by 2, it's odd
		  return number % 2 == 1;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		  int number;
		  number = 6;
		  if (isOdd(number)) {
		    System.out.println(number + " is odd.");
		  } else {
		    System.out.println(number + " is even.");
		  }

	}

}
```
