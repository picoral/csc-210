For our IDE (Integrated Development Environment), we will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).


1. Download [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
1. Open Eclipse and choose a working environment folder (you can just choose the default, or change it to another folder of your preference) -- click on `Launch`

1. Create a new Java project -- Uncheck the `Create module-info.java file` option and click on `Finish` 

![choose File > New > Java Project](images/java-project.png)

![unselect option for module-info.java and click finish](images/create-project.png)

1. With your new Java project selected, create a new Java class -- choose a name for your class, and select the `public static void main(String[] args)` option (we will be doing different things in the future, but for now, we will have a main method in our class) and click on `Finish`
