## Interface

* Objects define their interaction through their public methods
* Interfaces:
    * allow us to implement abstraction
    * primarily define methods that other classes must implement
    
## Example

On Eclipse choose `New > Interface`

```{java}
public interface CardGame {
	
	void setHand(int cardCount);
	
	int getHand();
	
	void setPlayers(int playerCount);
	
	int getPlayers();
	
}

```

Base on these methods, create a `PokerGame` class that `implements CardGame`

## Solution

```{java}
public class PokerGame implements CardGame {
	
	private int cardCount = 5;
	private int playerCount;
	
	public void setHand(int cardCount) {
		this.cardCount = cardCount;
	}
	
	public int getHand() {
		return cardCount;
	}
	
	public void setPlayers(int playerCount) {
		this.playerCount = playerCount;
	}
	
	public int getPlayers() {
		return playerCount;
	}
	

}
```
